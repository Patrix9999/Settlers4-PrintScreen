# The Settlers 4 Gold Edition: PrintScreen Plugin

This plugin is fixing black screenshot saved to the clipboard.  
Loading it will cause the screen to be properly saved inside the clipboard.  
**NOTE!** This plugin works only with The Settlers 4 Gold Edition (GoG version) (History Edition doesn't have this problem because it handles game window differently).

## How to use

You need an ASI Loader to use this mod. I recommend [The Settlers 4: ASI Loader](https://github.com/nyfrk/Settlers4-ASI-Loader) as it works nicely with the Gold and History Edition of The Settlers 4 and does not require any configuration. 

1. [Download](https://github.com/Patrix9999/Settlers4-PrintScreen/releases) a release.
2. Unpack the files into your `plugins` directory.
3. Start the game. The mod will load automatically.

To uninstall the mod remove `PrintScreen.asi` from your`plugins` directory.

Compile it yourself
Download Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 with the C++ toolchain. The project is configured to build it with the Windows 10 compatible v143 toolchain. However, you should be able to change the toolchain to whatever you like. No additional libraries are required so it should compile out of the box.
